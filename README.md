# __external

This is supposed to be an independent repo, but its files are supposed to be used directly from a **__multirepo**. 
This should be embedded into it, but the direction is the following: `__external -> __monorepo`.
We cannot use any direct links to the **__multirepo** content.

This is now embedded into the **__multirepo** as a submodule.

Reference to a file from the **__multirepo**: [README](../README.md)
